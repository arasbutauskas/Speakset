# Speakset

Speakset is a Discord-inspired interface recreation, built as a lightweight static web app.

## Features
- Server rail, channel list, chat panel, and member list layout.
- Dark theme with familiar Discord-like styling.
- Simple message composer that appends your message to the chat feed.
- Responsive behavior that hides the member list on smaller screens.

## Run locally
Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4173`.
